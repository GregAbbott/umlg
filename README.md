UMLG is a uml to java code generation tool.
From uml class diagrams it generates a persistent entity domain model.
The entities persisted via an embedded [Blueprints](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints) graph database.
It includes a gui to perform crud and query operations.

The documentation for UMLG can be found at this [location](http://umlg.org).
