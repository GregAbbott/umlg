Umlg Home Page
==============

Introduction
------------

Umlg is a uml to java code generator. Umlg generates, from uml class diagrams, java domain entities that persist in a graph database. For the persistence [Tinkerpop Blueprints](http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com/) is used. This ensures that Umlg is graph database agnostic.

In general, a class wraps a vertex and an associations between classes are realized as edges between vertexes.

Installation
------------

Umlg is available as a zipped archive and via maven.
Download eclipse and install papyrus.
